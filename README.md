# Description

Blackjack is a popular American card game, in fact, it happens to be the only one that is found at every single casino in the United States of America. The goal is to attain 'Blackjack' which would be a card combination of two integers that add to 21. Since the perfect 11 + 10 combination required to have 'Blackjack' isn't something you will regularly replicate, the goal is simply to have a value higher than the 'House' or the 'Dealer'.

Simply choose to hit or stand based on your current cards, not yet knowing what the dealer might have. The goal is to have a higher value than the dealer but remain under or at 21! Ace is valuated at 11 and is the only card to do so, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are all valuated at 10.

Good luck!

# Next Steps

1. Cleaning up of the CSS for the most optimal visual experience. The visuals are the most important accompaniment for a game that likely has been replicated many times. Visuals being what can set you apart.
2. Adding soft Ace functionality to allow for Aces to account for both of 1 or 11 interchangeably. An important feature as it really gives power to the Ace, as the Ace should be the most coveted card that an individual is able to draw.
3. Adding betting buttons that allow for more casino-like gambling. In creating a game that is as close to real-life Blackjack as possible, being able to have your decisions (hit and stand) carry more weight since they have money on the line should only foster a more invigorating experience.
